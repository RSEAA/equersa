# How can I make my presentation more accessible for the Accessibility Fellows?

Have a read of the Accessibility Awareness for Equersa presenters below and choose a maturity level (there are 3 levels) you are willing to aim for.  

# Slide 1 - Title
- Originally written as "Accessibility Awareness for Research Software Asia Australia (RSAA25) presenters"
- By Rowland Mosbergen, Harsh Kalra, and Sanchit Ghule

- Version 0.1
# Slide 2 - Learning Outcomes
- Participants will learn about how Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility (DEIA) has been designed at Research Software Asia Australia (RSAA25).
- Participants will learn about the needs of the Accessibility Fellows - Seaumul, Sandeep, Safaet - to understand why accessibility is important.
- Participants will learn the 3 maturity levels that they can do to help make their presentations more accessible.
- Participants will have an example (this presentation) of how accessibility can reduce barriers for the Accessibility Fellows.
- Participants will have extra resources to find out more about accessibility in general.
# Slide 3 - DEIA design at RSAA25
- Software engineering is essential for making software accessible and ensuring inclusivity.
- Designing DEIA to underpin RSAA25 prevents overlooking the needs of individuals with disabilities who belong to other marginalised groups.
- Highlighting Accessibility Fellows and Managers enhances accountability, provides more confidence that solutions are fit-for-purpose, and raises the profile of these Fellows and Managers.
- Highlighting key accessibility partners shares expertise and raises awareness to ensure a more inclusive framework for marginalised communities.
# Slide 4 - Understanding Why We Need Maturity Levels
- It is important to recognise that there are different levels of accessibility that can be attained. 
- Reading or follwoing a presentation as a person with a disability is usually slower than as an able bodied person.
- So if we want to be more inclusive, we should aim for a higher level of accessibility to make it as easy as possible.
- The more accessible you want your presentation to be, the more effort that you need to put in.
- Therefore we have provided three levels of maturity you can aim for around accessibility.
# Slide 5 - Maturity Level 1 - Simple Things You Can Do
- Add alt-text to every image, especially your complex diagrams.
- Write meaningful link text that clearly indicates the purpose of the hyperlink and avoid vague phrases like “click here” or “read more”.
- Run the accessibility checker in Microsoft Powerpoint and work through the suggestions, especially the logical reading order.
- Before your talk, share your slides to the community.
# Slide 6 - Maturity Level 2 - Intermediate Things You Can Do
- Make each slide consistent so it is easier for someone to navigate your slides in a screen reader.
- Write down in the slide all the key points you want to make.
- When giving your presentation, try to explain the diagrams similar to the alt-text as well explaining the key points you want to make.
- Limit or avoid transitions, animations, flashing or blinking objects.
# Slide 7 - Understanding Why We Need Maturity Level 3
- You have to recognise that reading a presentation with screen readers is slower than reading it like sighted people do.
- And different types of screen readers, like NVDA and JAWS read documents and presentations differently and glitches in the software can mean confusing and unnecessary noise.
- Consequently, crafting a presentation or document that is both efficient and effective for all screen readers can be a significant challenge.
- This means it can require a large number of people who can check the actual usability in multiple screen readers when using one document.
# Slide 8 - Understanding Why We Advocate for Two Documents
- In Maturity Level 3, we suggest you use two documents.
- Instead of dealing with the complexity of having to ask multiple people to confirm the usability of a single document, we would recommend creating two documents, one for sighted and one for people who use screen readers.
- This is because we have found that the less complexity in the document, the less noise and confusion happens from the glitches in the screen readers.
- This reduces the need for screen reader users to verify the efficiency and effectiveness of the simpler document as these can be easily read by all screen readers, especially if they are using Headers (eg. H1, H2, H3) alt-text, and hyperlinks.
# Slide 9 - Maturity Level 3 - Maximise Accessibility for Screen Readers
- Create a Google Doc and make it published via File > Share > Publish to Web to create a separate highly accessible document.
- Ensure you use H1 for each new slide “page” (similar to this document).
- Make sure there are no extra “returns” that create extra paragraphs. These look nice but slow down the screen reader with extra “new line” being read out.
- Have a glossary of terms can help people with screen readers understand terms to avoid confusion with acronyms eg. RSAA stands for Research Software Asia Australia.
- Share both your standard slides and this new highly accessible document with the community.
# Slide 10 - Extra Resources
- There are a few resources out there:
  -[ Not the Only One has a range of items on why accessibility is important from the viewpoint of those who need it](https://www.nottheonlyone.org/?search_query=accessib) and some tips as well.
  - [Make your PowerPoint presentations accessible to people with disabilities ](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/make-your-powerpoint-presentations-accessible-to-people-with-disabilities-6f7772b2-2f33-4bd2-8ca7-dae3b2b3ef25)
- This isn’t the end for accessibility
  - We can always improve and this should be considered a draft of what might work for some people.
