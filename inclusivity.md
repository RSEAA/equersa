# Inclusivity

To improve inclusivity and affordability, every year we offer scholarships for staff or students to participate for free, as well as accessibility micro-grants usually valued at around $50 AUD to help with internet, headphones, childcare etc.

## Eligibility

Eligibility for the scholarships are based on prioritising and maximising the inclusion and participation of people who have been impacted due to the cumulative effects of discrimination on factors such as race, gender, disability, gender identity, financial status, and the intersectionality of that discrimination, as well as others not mentioned here.

Eligibility for the accessibility micro-grants is based on a similar approach.

## How to Apply

More details, including how to apply, will be available soon.
