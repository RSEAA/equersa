# Welcome to the Research Software Latinoamérica (RSLA26) Landing Page 

Recently we have created an organising committee to host the first online Research Software Latinoamérica (RSLA26) conference in August 2026. This is a joint organising committee, setup by an umbrella organisation Equersa, that spans three conferences - RSLA, RSAA (Asia Australia) and RSA (Africa). 

This conference is based on the success of the Research Software Asia Australia ([RSAA](RSAA)) conferences that have been going since 2022.

We have three co-chairs at present:
1. Jesica Formoso,
2. Riva Quiroga, and
3. Luis Verde Arregoitia

We have 6 volunteers from 4 Latin American countries on our organising committee of 40+ volunteers from 16 countries.

If you would like to volunteer, you can [find out more on our Volunteers page](volunteers).
