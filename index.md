# Welcome to Equersa 

## Equitable global collaboration in Research Software

## Purpose Statement
Equersa fosters true global knowledge sharing and collaboration in research software through the creation of equitable environments for Research Software Engineers (RSEs are researchers who code, software engineers who work in the research domain, generalists who bring communities together, and sysadmins who maintain research software systems). We do this by creating safe spaces, creating opportunities, and breaking down barriers through shared power. 

## Services and Customers
Equersa supports conferences by creating a joint organising committee for [Research Software conferences in Asia and Australia](https://rseaa.org/), Africa and Latin America. We aim to give RSEs in overlooked regions a community to belong to.
