## Purpose Statement
Equersa fosters true global knowledge sharing and collaboration in research software through the creation of equitable environments for Research Software Engineers (RSEs are researchers who code, software engineers who work in the research domain, generalists who bring communities together, and sysadmins who maintain research software systems). We do this by creating safe spaces, creating opportunities, and breaking down barriers through shared power. 

## Services and Customers
Equersa supports conferences by creating a joint organising committee for [Research Software conferences in Asia and Australia](https://rseaa.org/), Africa and Latin America. We aim to give RSEs in overlooked regions a community to belong to.

## Want to Volunteer?

We are still welcoming volunteers, especially for Africa and Latin America. 

Time commitment for a regular volunteer is about 1 hour per week for 30 weeks. We will have a regular weekly meeting and you are encouraged to join part of those meetings to help you to connect with others and build a sense of community, as well as to contribute ideas and help out.

We have a lot of roles available in different areas as we want to have more than one person working on a particular area across all three conferences.  As an example we would ideally have three people volunteering for the marketing area that are from Asia, Africa and Latin America. You can find out more about the areas later in this document.

Ideally you would pick an area that you enjoy, or would like to learn, or you have experience in, that we also need help with. Please note that you don’t need to have experience in an area to contribute to it.

If we face challenges in maintaining regular volunteer support, we may need to set lower expectations for conference participants. We would rather push back against conference participant expectations than burn out our volunteers.

## Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Statement

We acknowledge that achieving inclusivity and equity is challenging, and we won't always get this right.  Everyone experiences different levels of difficulty, and the playing field is not level. We recognise that discrimination over time and intersectionality can also reduce opportunities.

We recognise that we may not be fully aware of all individual needs, and we may not be doing enough to address specific circumstances. 

We follow the principals created by [Practical Diversity and Inclusion](https://www.practicaldiversity.org/)
, and underpin that in as many processes as we can.
