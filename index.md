# Welcome to Equersa 

_Equitable global collaboration and opportunity in Research Software_

## Purpose Statement
Equersa fosters true global knowledge sharing and collaboration in research software through the creation of equitable environments for Research Software Engineers [^1]. We do this by creating safe spaces, creating opportunities, and breaking down barriers through shared power. 

[^1]: RSEs are researchers who code, software engineers who work in the research domain, generalists who bring communities together, and sysadmins who maintain research software systems

## What we do
Equersa supports conferences by creating a joint organising committee. These conferences are: 
- [Research Software Africa (RSA)](RSA)
- [Research Software Latinoamérica (RSLA)](RSLA)
- [Research Software Asia Australia (RSAA)](RSAA)

We aim to give RSEs in overlooked regions a community to belong to.

We do this in collaboration with [RSE Asia](https://rse-asia.github.io/RSE_Asia/) and [RSE-AUNZ](https://rse-aunz.org/).

## Want to Volunteer?

We are still welcoming volunteers, especially those closely connected to Africa and Latin America. 

Time commitment for a regular volunteer is about 1 hour per week for 30 weeks. We will have a regular weekly meeting and you are encouraged to join part of those meetings to help you to connect with others and build a sense of community, as well as to contribute ideas and help out.

## Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Statement

We acknowledge that achieving inclusivity and equity is challenging, and we won't always get this right.  Everyone experiences different levels of difficulty, and the playing field is not level. We recognise that discrimination over time and intersectionality can also reduce opportunities.

We recognise that we may not be fully aware of all individual needs, and we may not be doing enough to address specific circumstances. 

We follow the principals created by [Practical Diversity and Inclusion](https://www.practicaldiversity.org/), and underpin that in as many processes as we can. 

We do this by creating safe spaces, creating opportunities, and breaking down barriers through shared power.
