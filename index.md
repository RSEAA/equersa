## Purpose Statement
Equersa fosters true global knowledge sharing and collaboration in research software through the creation of equitable environments for Research Software Engineers (RSEs are researchers who code, software engineers who work in the research domain, generalists who bring communities together, and sysadmins who maintain research software systems). We do this by creating safe spaces, creating opportunities, and breaking down barriers through shared power. 

## Services and Customers
Equersa supports conferences by creating a joint organising committee for [Research Software conferences in Asia and Australia](https://rseaa.org/), Africa and Latin America. We aim to give RSEs in overlooked regions a community to belong to.

## Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Statement

We acknowledge that achieving inclusivity and equity is challenging, and we won't always get this right.  Everyone experiences different levels of difficulty, and the playing field is not level. We recognise that discrimination over time and intersectionality can also reduce opportunities.

We recognise that we may not be fully aware of all individual needs, and we may not be doing enough to address specific circumstances. 

We follow the principals created by [Practical Diversity and Inclusion](https://www.practicaldiversity.org/)
, and underpin that in as many processes as we can.
