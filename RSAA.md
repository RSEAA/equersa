# Welcome to the Research Software Asia Australia (RSAA26) Landing Page 

Research Software Asia Australia conferences have been going since 2022. You can [find out more about 2026 at the RSAA website](https://rseaa.org).

We have 23 volunteers from Australia and 4 Asian countries on our organising committee of 40+ volunteers from 16 countries. This is a joint organising committee, setup by an umbrella organisation Equersa, that spans three conferences - RSAA, [RSA (Africa)](RSA) and [RSLA (Latin America)](RSLA).
