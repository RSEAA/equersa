# Accessibility Fellows
Since 2024, Research Software Asia Australia has been running the Accessibility Fellowship Program

Every year, people can apply to be an Accessibility Fellow. 

The RSAA26 Accessibility Fellowship aims to encourage individuals with disabilities - such as those who are deaf, hard of hearing, blind, have low vision, or have other disabilities - from within our community or adjacent communities to join RSAA26. Their involvement will help ensure we are held accountable for the accessibility of this online event.

To strengthen gender diversity in our accessibility fellowship, we especially encourage women and gender fluid disabled people to apply. We value the unique perspectives and experiences you bring.
