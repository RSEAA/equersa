# Welcome to the Research Software Africa Landing Page 

Recently we have created an organising committee to host the first online Research Software Africa (RSA26) conference in August 2026.

This conference is based on the success of the Research Software Asia Australia ([RSAA](RSAA)) conferences that have been going since 2022.

We have three co-chairs at present:
1. Peculiar Umeh,
2. Michael Umeokoli, and
3. Kim Martin 

We have 12 volunteers from 8 African countries in total on our organising committee.

If you would like to volunteer, you can [find out more on our Volunteers page](volunteers).
