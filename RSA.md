# Welcome to the Research Software Africa (RSA26) Landing Page 

Recently we have created an organising committee to host the first online Research Software Africa (RSA26) conference in August 2026. This is a joint organising committee, setup by an umbrella organisation Equersa, that spans three conferences - RSA, RSAA (Asia Australia) and RSLA (Latin America). 

This conference is based on the success of the Research Software Asia Australia ([RSAA](RSAA)) conferences that have been going since 2022.

We have three co-chairs at present:
1. Peculiar Umeh,
2. Michael Umeokoli, and
3. Kim Martin 

We have 12 volunteers from 8 African countries on our organising committee of 40+ volunteers from 16 countries.

If you would like to volunteer, you can [find out more on our Volunteers page](volunteers).
